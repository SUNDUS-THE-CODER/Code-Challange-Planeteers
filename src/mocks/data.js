    bio: "It could be argued that without Greta Thunberg, there would be no youth climate strike movement. The 16-year-old Swedish climate activist has been striking outside of the parliament building in Stockholm since last August, and is the founder of the Fridays for Future youth climate strike movement. Her impassioned speeches have left politicians speechless and millions of young people inspired around the world. “Our house is falling apart and our leaders need to start acting accordingly because at the moment they are not,” Greta demanded of Members of the European Parliament and EU officials in Strasbourg in April.",
    quote: "Yes, we are failing, but there is still time to turn everything around — we can still fix this. I want you to act as if the house was on fire. Because it is.",

    born: 1995,
    bio: "Thomas Tonatiuh Lopez, 24, was arrested at Standing Rock while praying. It was traumatic but helped him find his place as a leader, in the tradition of his father who is a Sundance Chief. Both of Lopez's parents were Indigenous civil rights leaders in the 1970s, both taking part in the occupation of Alcatraz in 1969 and Wounded Knee in 1973, which called attention to dismal living conditions and civil rights abuses that Native Americans continued to endure. He himself has been an LGBTQ rights advocate. He identifies as Chicano, with roots in the Mexica people of Mexico, and Sicangu Lakota Oyate from South Dakota, though he grew up in Denver. He talked about the inclusive community he found at Standing Rock that compelled him to join the camp for three months instead of his initial one-day plan.",
    quote: "Even though I had a lot of pain come out of the experience of the arrest, it inspired a lot of people. And those are the things sometimes you have to do as a leader. You have to take that pain for our people so that we can inspire others to stand up.",
